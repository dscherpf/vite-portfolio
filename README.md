# A simple portfolio

This site is bare-bones trial run for Vite and an exercise in getting away from comforts like SCSS and Vuetify.

## Domain
- Custom Domain: [scherpf.us](https://scherpf.us)

## A note about the branches
Pushing changes to `main` will trigger a deployment to the `gh-pages` branch - the live site. Don't make changes directly to the `gh-pages` branch. 

## Managing the site
